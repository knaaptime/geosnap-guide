<h2 align="center" style="margin-top:-10px">The Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis Package</h2><p><code>geosnap</code> makes it easier to explore, model, analyze, and visualize the social and spatial dynamics
of neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods are important for a wide variety of reasons, but they’re hard to study
because of some long-standing challenges, including that</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no formal definition of a
<a href="https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2019/01/29/once-and-future-neighborhood">“neighborhood”</a> so
identifying and modeling them is frought with uncertainty</li>
<li>many different physical and social data can characterize a neighborhood (e.g. its
proximity to the urban core, its share of residents with a high school education, or the
median price of its apartments) so there are countless ways to model neighborhoods by
choosing different subsets of attributes</li>
<li>conceptually, neighborhoods evolve through both space and time, meaning their
socially-construed boundaries can shift over time, as can their demographic makeup.</li>
<li>geographic tabulation units change boundaries over time, meaning the raw data are
aggregated to different areal units at differerent points in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these challenges,<code>geosnap</code> provides a suite of tools for creating socio-spatial
datasets, harmonizing those datasets into consistent set of time-static boundaries,
modeling bespoke neighborhoods and prototypical neighborhood types, and modeling
neighborhood change using classic and spatial statistical methods.
It also provides a set of static and interactive visualization tools to help you display
and understand the critical information at each step of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Batteries Included:</strong>
<code>geosnap</code> comes packed with 30 years of census data, thanks to <a href="https://quiltdata.com/">quilt</a>, so you
can get started modeling neighborhoods in the U.S. immediately.
But you’re not just limited to the data provided with the package. <code>geosnap</code>
works with any data you provide, any place in the world.</p>
<h2 id="Architecture">Architecture<a class="anchor-link" href="#Architecture"> </a></h2><p>Most interaction in geosnap happens with a <code>Community</code>, and almost all of geosnap's functionality is available as a method on a <code>Community</code> object. But when you need to use other fetures, like access data or launch an interactive visuzalization, you may need to access functions in one of geosnap's submodules.</p>
<h3 id="geosnap-has-five-modules:"><code>geosnap</code> has five modules:<a class="anchor-link" href="#geosnap-has-five-modules:"> </a></h3><ul>
<li><p><strong><code>datasets</code></strong>:   Access built-in datasets, including 30 years of census data for the USA,  and databases stored with functions from the <code>io</code> module</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>io</code></strong>:  Ingest, create, and manipulate space-time datasets</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>analyze</code></strong>:  Analyze and model neighborhood boundaries and spatio-temporal dynamics</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>harmonize</code></strong>:  Harmonize neighborhood boundaries into consistent, stable units using spatial statistical
methods</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><code>visualize</code></strong>:  Visualize neighborhood dynamics</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Installation">Installation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installation"> </a></h2><p>The recommended method for installing geosnap is with
