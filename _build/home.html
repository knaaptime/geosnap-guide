of neighborhoods.
Neighborhoods are important for a wide variety of reasons, but they’re hard to study
because of some long-standing challenges, including that</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no formal definition of a
<a href="https://www.cnu.org/publicsquare/2019/01/29/once-and-future-neighborhood">“neighborhood”</a> so
identifying and modeling them is frought with uncertainty</li>
<li>many different physical and social data can characterize a neighborhood (e.g. its
proximity to the urban core, its share of residents with a high school education, or the
median price of its apartments) so there are countless ways to model neighborhoods by
choosing different subsets of attributes</li>
<li>conceptually, neighborhoods evolve through both space and time, meaning their
socially-construed boundaries can shift over time, as can their demographic makeup.</li>
<li>geographic tabulation units change boundaries over time, meaning the raw data are
aggregated to different areal units at differerent points in time.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address these challenges,<code>geosnap</code> provides a suite of tools for creating socio-spatial
datasets, harmonizing those datasets into consistent set of time-static boundaries,
modeling bespoke neighborhoods and prototypical neighborhood types, and modeling
neighborhood change using classic and spatial statistical methods.
It also provides a set of static and interactive visualization tools to help you display
and understand the critical information at each step of the process.</p>
<p><strong>Batteries Included:</strong>
<code>geosnap</code> comes packed with 30 years of census data, thanks to <a href="https://quiltdata.com/">quilt</a>, so you
can get started modeling neighborhoods in the U.S. immediately.
But you’re not just limited to the data provided with the package. <code>geosnap</code>
works with any data you provide, any place in the world.</p>

</p><h2 id="Installation">Installation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installation"> </a></h2><p>The recommended method for installing geosnap is with
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">anaconda</a>. To get started with the development version,
clone this repository or download it manually then <code>cd</code> into the directory and run the
following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate geosnap 
python setup.py develop
</pre></div>
<p>This will download the appropriate dependencies and install geosnap in its own conda
environment.</p>
