It is built upon shared functionality in two exploratory spatial data analysis packages GeoDA and STARSand is intended to leverage the shared development of these components. This paper presents an overview of the motivation behind and the design of PySAL, as well as suggestions for how the library can be used with other software projects. Empirical illustrations of several key components in a variety of spatial analytical problems are given, and plans for future development of PySAL are discussed.},

This includes traditional desktop software (with a graphical user interface, command line or embedded in a computational notebook), open spatial analytics middleware, and web, cloud and distributed open geospatial analytics for decision support. A common thread throughout the discussion is the emphasis on openness, interoperability, and provenance management in a scientific workflow. The code base of the PySAL library provides the common computing framework underlying all delivery mechanisms.},

Written in Python, the library has a long history of supporting novel scholarship and broadening methodological impacts far afield of academic work. Recently, many new techniques, methods of analyses, and development modes have been implemented, making the library much larger and more encompassing than that previously discussed in the literature. As such, we provide an introduction to the library as it stands now, as well as the scientific and conceptual underpinnings of its core set of components. Finally, we provide a prospective look at the library's future evolution.},
